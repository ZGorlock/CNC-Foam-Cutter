    <h2 id="c1">Router System</h2>

    <h3>Safety information</h3>
    <p>In case of emergency please press the emergency stop button FIRST, before proceeding to stop the streaming process.
        The emergency stop button kills all power to the machine (this includes the router), the control board is powered through
        the computer so it is also important to pause/stop the streaming process. If you'd like to stall the machine
        please send a "!" command from the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>, this stalls the next instruction, but not the current one!</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Calibrating</h3>
    <p>You should zero the machine by moving to the southwest corner of the foam and moving the endmill down until it is about to touch the base.
        Do not move it so far that it actually touches the base or you will damage the machine.
        Once it is in this position, zero the machine by pressing Spacebar while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a> as specified below.
        Then proceed to move the endmill up and position your foam. Please read the rest of this section before attempting this.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable the keyboard movement option, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for +Y</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for -Y</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <p>Additionally, you can set by how many steps the machine will move, and you can edit configurations through our config file.
        Please do not touch the config file unless you know what you are doing. You are encouraged to look up information about grbl to get more acquainted
        with the machine.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Foam Positioning for CNC</h3>
    <p>The foam should be larger than your model to cut but smaller than the maximum size of the machine (18"x29"x8" max).
        In the case of cutting from an STL file, please make sure the model fits inside the foam you have chosen and that the foam fits inside the machine.
        The machine will cut your model in the center of the foam you provide and at the top of the foam if the model height is less than the foam height.
        Place the machine in the center of every axis. This helps the machine not to go outside of bounds, however it is imperative to be present during
        cutting in case of emergencies. This machine uses absolute coordinates only for stl files, for gcode files, this is up to you.</p>
    <p>In case of cutting from a gcode file, you must position it according to your model's needs. It is imperative to be present during cutting
        in case of emergencies, and it is recommended to conduct small tests to get familiar with the system.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Start Cutting</h3>
    <p>To start cutting make power is running through the machine and you've zero'd it out to your desired position by pressing SPACEBAR to zero out.
        Now you can flip the switch on the router and the endmill will start spinning, by no means should you ever touch the endmill. For some cuts, you might
        need to start the router and then move it into the foam in a -Z direction, then zero it out, then start the cut. This is completely acceptable, and
        recommended for STL file cuts. To convert STL files to G-code we are using an open source software called Slic3r TM, we'd like to remind you
        no software is perfect, and if you'd like to get an extremely professional cut you should provide your own G-code.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>STL files</h3>
    <p>Please refer to our User Guide on a visual help of how STL files should be model. Models should be in millimeters as units.
    This machine can only do shapes that are U shaped, you cannot cut under the foam because it the endmill does not have a rotation
    axis, so it can't twist. If you need to do an upside down U, consider designing it upside down to make it a regular U shape.</p>

    <h2 id="c2">Uploading Your Model</h2>

    <h3>Model Format</h3>
    <p>Our software takes as input a .STL file or .gcode file. It allows for 1 gcode command per line.
        It uses relative coordinates to give you more freedom of cut. The max size in millimeters is (+/- 695mm (X) by 0->1219mm (Y)).</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Uploading the Model</h3>
    <p>To upload the file/model you can simply drag the file/model if thats the only thing the folder is containing. You can also
        paste the path to this file/model in the search bar or click choose and the file/model you need.
        It should follow the appropriate formal.
        It is important to set accurate dimensions for your foam so you can visualize the cut into the foam before printing.</p>

    <h2 id="c3">The Model Tab</h2>

    <h3>Information Overview</h3>
    <p>In this tab, you can view information you've provided us such as NID, description, plus other useful information like the size of the
        file, the file name, the code's current progress, and time remaining.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Model Preview</h3>
    <p>This is a 3D rendering of the model if it is an stl file, or just an indication it is a gcode file. You can drag the 3D model, zoom in and out of it.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Progress Indication</h3>
    <p>There is a progress percentage in the Model tab for your use, there is also an estimate of the time remaining to complete the cut.</p>

    <br/>

    <h2 id="c4">The G-code Tab</h2>

    <h3>Keyboard Controls</h3>
    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable keyboard movement option by clicking the checkbox, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for -Y (Up)</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for +Y (Down)</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <br/>

    <h3>G-code Streaming</h3>
    <p>We stream G-code based on the recommended Grbl streaming protocol. You can see instructions as they move in the first black box and you can also give your own commands
        that will be prioritized over the next instruction to be sent. In the second black box you will see responses to the commands you sent. Any
        instruction should be typed in the smallest black box.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>G-code Queries</h3>
    <p>To ask the machine where it currently is, please send a "?" command in the command-line box. You can press enter or click the button to send.</p>

    <h2 id="c5">The Tracer Tab</h2>

    <h3>Spindle Tracing</h3>
    <p>We've provided a preview of the machine's cuts by drawing lines between the points given. This is a good way to see how our machine
    will cut out what you've given us, you can even run while having the machine turned off if you want to see your result before cutting
    anything at all!</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Status Indication</h3>
    <p>Under the tracing drawing, you are able to see Grbl's last instruction's coordinates.</p>

    <h2 id="c6">Software We Use</h2>

    <h3>How Slic3r Works</h3>
    <p>Slic3r is a 3D printing software that converts STL file into G-code. To use 3D printing for CNC milling, we cut the shape into the foam. This is
        why this software best performs "undercuts". If you're going to be using Slicer for your milling needs, it's best to run tests to get familiar with it.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>How Grbl Works</h3>
    <p>Grbl is a G-code compiler written in C designed for Arduino UNO / Duemillanova. This compiler interprets G-code commands sent through our interface in file
        form through command line. We'd like to remind you that no software is perfect, Grbl only works for a subset of G-code compilable instructions and we've
        made sure any command that goes through is modified/deleted if it does not comply. If a certain parameter of an instruction won't comply but the overall command
        works then we will only modify that parameter.</p>
