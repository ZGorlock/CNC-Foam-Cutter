    <h2 id="c1">Router System</h2>
    <h3>Safety information</h3>
    <p>In case of emergency please press the emergency stop button FIRST, before proceeding to stop the streaming process.
    The emergency stop button kills all power to the machine (this includes the router), the control board is powered through
        the computer so it is also important to pause/stop the streaming process. If you'd like to stall the machine
    please send a "!" command.</p>

    <h3>Calibrating</h3>
    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable the keyboard movement option, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for +Y</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for -Y</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <p>Additionally, you can set by how many steps the machine will move, and you can edit configurations through our config file.
        Please do not touch the config file unless you know what you are doing. You are encouraged to look up information about grbl to get more acquainted
        with the machine.</p>

    <h3>Foam Positioning for CNC</h3>
    <p>In case of cutting from an STL file, please make sure the foam fits inside the machine. The foam should be larger than your model to cut.
    Place the machine in the center of every axis. This helps the machine not to go outside of bounds, however it is imperative to be present during
    cutting in case of emergencies. This machine uses absolute coordinates only for stl files, for gcode files, this is up to you.</p>
    <p>In case of cutting from a gcode file, you must position it according to your model's needs. It is imperative to be present during cutting
    in case of emergencies, and it is recommended to conduct small tests to get familiar with the system.</p>

    <h3>Start cutting</h3>
    <p>To start cutting make power is running through the machine and you've zero'd it out to your desired position by pressing SPACEBAR to zero out.
    Now you can flip the switch on the router and the endmill will start spinning, by no means should you ever touch the endmill. For some cuts, you might
    need to start the router and then move it into the foam in a -Z direction, then zero it out, then start the cut. This is completely acceptable, and
    recommended for STL file cuts. To convert STL files to G-code we are using an open source software called Slicer TM, we'd like to remind you
    no software is perfect, and if you'd like to get an extremely professional cut you should provide your own G-code.</p>
    <h3>STL files</h3>
    <p>Please refer to our User Guide on a visual help of how STL files should be model. Models should be in millimeters as units.</p>

    <h2 id="c2">Hotwire System</h2>
    <h3>Safety information</h3>
    <p>In case of emergency please kill all power to the machine FIRST, before proceeding to stop the streaming process.
        Killing all power to the machine ensures the wire will commence cooling down, the control board is powered through
        the computer so it is also important to pause/stop the streaming process.</p>
    <p>Please never cut indoors as melting foam is toxic.</p>
    <p>Please never ever for any reason at all touch the HOT wire, as it is above 500 degrees Fahrenheit, adjustable temperature through
    the dimmer. Please allow several minutes before touching the hotwire. Only touch it after it has cooled down for several minutes, if absolutely necessary
    and with a piece of foam preferably to ensure it is actually cool.</p>

    <h3>Calibrating</h3>
    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable the keyboard movement option, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for +Y</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for -Y</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <p>Additionally, you can prompt our machine for its configurations by sending a $$ command, or viewing our config file.
    Please do not touch the config file unless you know what you are doing.</p>

    h3>Foam Positioning for Hotwire</h3>
    <p>Please position the wire in the center top position to get ready for a cut. Please ensure to leave a small amount of foam at the bottom of your model
        to use as a handle. Do not attempt undercuts. Please position your foam in the center of the rotating bed.</p>

    <h3>Start cutting</h3>
    <p>To start cutting make power is running through the machine and you've zero'd it out to your desired position by pressing SPACEBAR to zero out. It is
        recommende to set the wire in the top middle of the machine. It is highly recommended to run small tests to get acquainted with the system.</p>

    <h2 id="c3">Software we use</h2>
    <h3>How Slicer Works</h3>
    <p>Slicer is a 3D printing software that converts STL file into G-code. To use 3D printing for CNC milling, we cut the shape into the foam. This is
        why this software best performs "undercuts". If you're going to be using Slicer for your milling needs, it's best to run tests to get familiar with it,
        if you feel like we've explained everything in exuberant detail, please run some tests.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>How Grbl Works</h3>
    <p>Grbl is a G-code compiler written in C designed for Arduino UNO/Duemillanova. This compiler interprets G-code commands sent through our interface in file
    form through command line. We'd like to remind you that no software is perfect, Grbl only works for a subset of G-code compilable instructions and we've
    made sure any command that goes through is modified/deleted if it does not comply. If a certain parameter of an instruction won't comply but the overall command
    works then we will only modify that parameter.</p>
