    <h2 id="c1">Router System</h2>

    <h3>Safety information</h3>
    <p>In case of emergency please press the emergency stop button FIRST, before proceeding to stop the streaming process.
        The emergency stop button kills all power to the machine (this includes the router), the control board is powered through
        the computer so it is also important to pause/stop the streaming process. If you'd like to stall the machine
        please send a "!" command from the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Calibrating</h3>
    <p>You should zero the machine by moving to the southwest corner of the foam and moving the endmill down until it is about to touch the base.
        Do not move it so far that it actually touches the base or you will damage the machine.
        Once it is in this position, zero the machine by pressing Spacebar while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a> as specified below.
        Then proceed to move the endmill up and position your foam. Please read the rest of this section before attempting this.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable the keyboard movement option, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for +Y</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for -Y</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <p>Additionally, you can set by how many steps the machine will move, and you can edit configurations through our config file.
        Please do not touch the config file unless you know what you are doing. You are encouraged to look up information about grbl to get more acquainted
        with the machine.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Foam Positioning for CNC</h3>
    <p>The foam should be larger than your model to cut but smaller than the maximum size of the machine (18"x29"x8" max).
        In the case of cutting from an STL file, please make sure the model fits inside the foam you have chosen and that the foam fits inside the machine.
        The machine will cut your model in the center of the foam you provide and at the top of the foam if the model height is less than the foam height.
        Place the machine in the center of every axis. This helps the machine not to go outside of bounds, however it is imperative to be present during
        cutting in case of emergencies. This machine uses absolute coordinates only for stl files, for gcode files, this is up to you.</p>
    <p>In case of cutting from a gcode file, you must position it according to your model's needs. It is imperative to be present during cutting
        in case of emergencies, and it is recommended to conduct small tests to get familiar with the system.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Start Cutting</h3>
    <p>To start cutting make power is running through the machine and you've zero'd it out to your desired position by pressing SPACEBAR to zero out.
        Now you can flip the switch on the router and the endmill will start spinning, by no means should you ever touch the endmill. For some cuts, you might
        need to start the router and then move it into the foam in a -Z direction, then zero it out, then start the cut. This is completely acceptable, and
        recommended for STL file cuts. To convert STL files to G-code we are using an open source software called Slic3r TM, we'd like to remind you
        no software is perfect, and if you'd like to get an extremely professional cut you should provide your own G-code.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>STL files</h3>
    <p>TODO Please refer to our User Guide on a visual help of how STL files should be model. Models should be in millimeters as units.</p>

    <h2 id="c6">Software We Use</h2>

    <h3>How Slic3r Works</h3>
    <p>Slic3r is a 3D printing software that converts STL file into G-code. To use 3D printing for CNC milling, we cut the shape into the foam. This is
        why this software best performs "undercuts". If you're going to be using Slicer for your milling needs, it's best to run tests to get familiar with it.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>How Grbl Works</h3>
    <p>Grbl is a G-code compiler written in C designed for Arduino UNO / Duemillanova. This compiler interprets G-code commands sent through our interface in file
        form through command line. We'd like to remind you that no software is perfect, Grbl only works for a subset of G-code compilable instructions and we've
        made sure any command that goes through is modified/deleted if it does not comply. If a certain parameter of an instruction won't comply but the overall command
        works then we will only modify that parameter.</p>
