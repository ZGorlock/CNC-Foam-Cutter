    <h2 id="c1">Hotwire Machine</h2>

    <h3>Safety information</h3>
    <p>In case of emergency please kill all power to the machine FIRST, before proceeding to stop the streaming process.
        Killing all power to the machine ensures the wire will commence cooling down, the control board is powered through
        the computer so it is also important to pause/stop the streaming process.</p>
    <p>Please never cut indoors as melting foam is toxic! If for any reason you'd like to stall the machine
        please send a "!" command from the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>, this stalls the next instruction, but not the current one!
        For emergencies, kill all power to the machine, and wait for the last instruction sent to
        be completed. This might take a while so it's best to wait several minutes before returning power to the machine.</p>
    <p>Please never ever for any reason at all touch the HOT wire, as it is heated to over 500 degrees Fahrenheit, adjust the temperature through
        the dimmer switch. Please allow several minutes before touching the hotwire. Only touch it after it has cooled down for several minutes, if absolutely necessary
        and with a piece of foam first to ensure it is actually cool.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Calibrating</h3>
    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable the keyboard movement option, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for -Y (Up)</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for +Y (Down)</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <p>Additionally, you can set by how many steps the machine will move, and you can edit configurations through our config file located at <i>./confiuration/config.ini</i>.
        Please do not touch the config file unless you know what you are doing. You are encouraged to look up information about grbl to get more acquainted
        with the machine.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Foam Positioning for Hotwire</h3>
    <p>The foam should be larger than your model but smaller than the maximum size of the machine (36"x36"x48" max).
        Please position your foam in the center of the rotating bed. It is important that it is as centered as possible to ensure an accurate cut.
        Please position the wire in the center top position of the foam to get ready for a cut.
        Please ensure to leave a small amount of foam at the bottom of your model
        to use as a handle. Do not attempt cut too close to the rotating bed.
        If at the end of your cut you wish to cut the foam handle/base off, then we recommend to use the keyboard controls feature on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>
        to maneuver around the foam.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Start Cutting</h3>
    <p>To start cutting make sure power is running through the machine and that you've zero'd the wire to your desired position by pressing SPACEBAR to zero out. It is
        recommended to set the wire in the top middle of the foam. It is highly recommended to run small tests to get acquainted with the system.
        For best results and for safety, please standby the machine during the cut, wires break and things happen, stretching out the wire because one motor
        is ahead of the other is a possibility that should encourage you to be close enough to turn the machine off at any point.

    <h2 id="c2">Uploading Your Profiles</h2>

    <h3>Profile Format</h3>
    <p>The profiles for this machine are stored as .gcode files. Most softwares that convert 2D planes to gcode do it in .tap, it is safe to just rename it to .gcode.
        It will be assumed that the instructions are in relative coordinates. You can set them to absolute coordinates by including a G90 command at the beginning of your file.
        You are only allowed to put one gcode instruction per line, for example, "G90 G21 G0 X50" is not acceptable and will be ignored.
        The max size in millimeters is (+/- 695mm (X) by 0->1219mm (Y)) assuming you zero at the center of the X axis and the top of the Y axis.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Uploading the Profiles</h3>
    <p>To upload the profiles you can simply drag the folder containing the profiles.
        You can also paste the path to this folder in the search bar or click choose and select all the profiles you need. All must be in the appropriate .gcode extension.
        It is important to set accurate dimensions for your foam so you can visualize the cut into the foam before printing.
        Once you are on the <a href="#c3">Rotation Tab</a>, you are able to click and drag the profiles to reorder them.</p>

    <br/>

    <h2 id="c3">The Rotation Tab</h2>

    <h3>Profile Previews</h3>
    <p>Once uploaded, you will be taken to the rotation tab, which contains all the profiles. We draw these out by reading through the files you uploaded and tracing them.
        You will also see the axes lines and an outline of the position of the foam within the machine.
        If one isn't showing how you expect it, please revise the gcode and make sure all files contain one command max per line.
        You can click and drag the profiles relative to each other to reorder them to the order you would like them to print.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Setting Rotation Step</h3>
    <p>To set a rotation step choose from the drop down menu how much you would like each profile to take up over the 360 degree area.
        The minimum rotation step you can choose is 1/100, meaning there will be 100 profiles over the 360 degrees of the model, or 1 profile per 3.6 degrees.
        If you set the rotation to 1/4, the machine will cut 4 profiles during the printing process, rotating 90 degrees per cut.
        This would allow you to cut out a four-sided pyramid, for instance, by setting a single slanted profile for the step rotation.
        If you choose "None", then the machine will only print a single profile and will not rotate at all.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Setting Profile Steps</h3>
    <p>You are also able to specify the step count for each profile you uploaded.
        If you have 2 profiles and you would like to cut one profile for 90 degrees and the other for the remaining 270 degrees, and your rotation step is 1/100,
        you can set the steps for the first profile to 25, and the steps for the second profile to 75.
        The application will not let you begin the printing process unless the number of steps totals a full rotation relative to the rotation step.</p>

    <h2 id="c4">The G-code Tab</h2>

    <h3>Keyboard Controls</h3>
    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable keyboard movement option by clicking the checkbox, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for +Y</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for -Y</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z (Up)</li>
    <li>L for -Z (Down)</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <br/>

    <h3>G-code Streaming</h3>
    <p>We stream G-code based on the recommended Grbl streaming protocol. You can see instructions as they move in the first black box and you can also give your own commands
        that will be prioritized over the next instruction to be sent. In the second black box you will see responses to the commands you sent. Any
        instruction should be typed in the smallest black box.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>G-code Queries</h3>
    <p>To ask the machine where it currently is, please send a "?" command in the command-line box. You can press enter or click the button to send.
        You can halt the machine by sending a "!" command.
        You can also send any other gcode instruction as a query.</p>

    <h2 id="c6">Software We Use</h2>

    <h3>How Grbl Works</h3>
    <p>Grbl is a G-code compiler written in C designed for Arduino UNO / Duemillanova. This compiler interprets G-code commands sent through our interface in file
        form through command line. We'd like to remind you that no software is perfect, Grbl only works for a subset of G-code compilable instructions and we've
        made sure any command that goes through is modified/deleted if it does not comply. If a certain parameter of an instruction won't comply but the overall command
        works then we will only modify that parameter.</p>
