    <h2 id="c1">Hotwire Machine</h2>

    <h3>Safety information</h3>
    <p>In case of emergency please kill all power to the machine FIRST, before proceeding to stop the streaming process.
        Killing all power to the machine ensures the wire will commence cooling down, the control board is powered through
        the computer so it is also important to pause/stop the streaming process.</p>
    <p>Please never cut indoors as melting foam is toxic! If for any reason you'd like to stall the machine
        please send a "!" command from the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>, but for emergencies, kill all power to the machine, and wait for the last instruction sent to
        be completed. This might take a while so it's best to wait several minutes before returning power to the machine.</p>
    <p>Please never ever for any reason at all touch the HOT wire, as it is heated to over 500 degrees Fahrenheit, adjust the temperature through
        the dimmer switch. Please allow several minutes before touching the hotwire. Only touch it after it has cooled down for several minutes, if absolutely necessary
        and with a piece of foam first to ensure it is actually cool.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Calibrating</h3>
    <p>To move the machine you can send G-code commands or move it using your keyboard while on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>.
        To move it using your keyboard you must first enable the keyboard movement option, which allows you to move:</p>
    <li>W for -Y (Up)</li>
    <li>A for -X</li>
    <li>S for +Y (Down)</li>
    <li>D for +X</li>
    <li>P for +Z</li>
    <li>L for -Z</li>
    <li>R for RESET = $X</li>
    <li>SPACEBAR for Reset Zero Location</li>
    <p>Additionally, you can set by how many steps the machine will move, and you can edit configurations through our config file located at <i>./confiuration/config.ini</i>.
        Please do not touch the config file unless you know what you are doing. You are encouraged to look up information about grbl to get more acquainted
        with the machine.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Foam Positioning for Hotwire</h3>
    <p>The foam should be larger than your model but smaller than the maximum size of the machine (36"x36"x48" max).
        Please position your foam in the center of the rotating bed. It is important that it is as centered as possible to ensure an accurate cut.
        Please position the wire in the center top position of the foam to get ready for a cut.
        Please ensure to leave a small amount of foam at the bottom of your model
        to use as a handle. Do not attempt cut too close to the rotating bed.
        If at the end of your cut you wish to cut the foam handle/base off, then we recommend to use the keyboard controls feature on the <a href="#4">G-code Tab</a>
        to maneuver around the foam.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Start Cutting</h3>
    <p>To start cutting make sure power is running through the machine and that you've zero'd the wire to your desired position by pressing SPACEBAR to zero out. It is
        recommended to set the wire in the top middle of the foam. It is highly recommended to run small tests to get acquainted with the system.
        For best results and for safety, please standby the machine during the cut, wires break and things happen, stretching out the wire because one motor
        is ahead of the other is a possibility that should encourage you to be close enough to turn the machine off at any point.

    <h2 id="c6">Software We Use</h2>

    <h3>How Slic3r Works</h3>
    <p>Slic3r is a 3D printing software that converts STL file into G-code. To use 3D printing for CNC milling, we cut the shape into the foam. This is
        why this software best performs "undercuts". If you're going to be using Slicer for your milling needs, it's best to run tests to get familiar with it.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>How Grbl Works</h3>
    <p>Grbl is a G-code compiler written in C designed for Arduino UNO / Duemillanova. This compiler interprets G-code commands sent through our interface in file
        form through command line. We'd like to remind you that no software is perfect, Grbl only works for a subset of G-code compilable instructions and we've
        made sure any command that goes through is modified/deleted if it does not comply. If a certain parameter of an instruction won't comply but the overall command
        works then we will only modify that parameter.</p>
